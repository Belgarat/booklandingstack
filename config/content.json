  "aboutBook": "<p><strong>Fish Cannot Carry Guns</strong> is a collection of speculative short stories that delve into how technology fractures identity, erodes trust, and distorts reality. For fans of Black Mirror, cyberpunk noir, and fringe futurism, these slow-burning, unsettling tales challenge what it means to be human in a world ruled by code.</p><p>Each story explores the intersection of humanity and technology, asking questions about trust, identity, and the price of progress. From androids questioning their programming to humans trapped in digital prisons, these tales push the boundaries of what we think we know about consciousness and reality.</p>",
