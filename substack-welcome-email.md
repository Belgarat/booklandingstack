# Welcome to Book Landing Stack! ðŸ“š

Hey there, fellow indie author!

Thanks for joining the journey as I build Book Landing Stack in public. You're now part of a community of authors who believe that landing pages should actually convert readers into buyers.

## What You'll Get

- **Behind-the-scenes insights** into building an open source framework
- **Real metrics and results** from actual book landing pages
- **Technical deep-dives** into Next.js, Supabase, and conversion optimization
- **Community stories** from indie authors who are making it work
- **Early access** to templates and tools as they're developed

## The Vision

Book Landing Stack isn't just another landing page builder. It's a framework for understanding how readers think, feel, and make purchasing decisions. We're building landing pages that don't just look goodâ€”they feel right for books.

## Your First Steps

1. **Check your spam folder** if you don't see future emails
2. **Reply to this email** and tell me about your biggest frustration with book marketing
3. **Share with a fellow author** who might be struggling with conversions

## What's Coming Next

The first post drops this week: "Why Your Book Deserves Better Than a Generic Landing Page" - where I'll share the real story behind why I'm building this framework.

## Quick Favor

If you have 2 minutes, I'd love to hear about your book marketing challenges. Just hit reply and tell me:
- What genre you write in
- Your biggest frustration with current landing page tools
- What conversion rate you're currently seeing

Your feedback will help shape Book Landing Stack into something that actually works for indie authors.
